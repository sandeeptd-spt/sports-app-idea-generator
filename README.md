*   **Tab transition:** When switching between tabs, there is a transition effect that fades in and out the content.

## Save ideas

We have added the save idea functionality. Add a save button to every idea card that allows the user to save the idea. The saved ideas are saved in the local storage and when the page is reloaded the ideas remain saved. The saved ideas are showed in the saved ideas tab.
  
## Progress

We have created a base structure with the `Layout`, `IdeaCard`, `IdeaForm` and `useIdeas` files. The `App` file is also created to integrate all of these components. The user can enter a prompt in the `IdeaForm` component, press the button to generate ideas and they will be displayed in cards using the `IdeaCard` component. All the generated ideas are being managed by the `useIdeas` hook that shares the data between the `IdeaForm` and `IdeaCard` components. The layout component has 3 tabs, Generated Ideas, Saved Ideas and Marketplace. 

## Getting Started

Details on how to get the project set up locally will be provided in the future.

## Goals

*   Make sports tech innovation accessible
*   Enable product discovery within racket sports
*   Foster community through buying/selling

## Future Development

We have plans to integrate more features, such as gamification elements, advanced search and filtering, and more.
